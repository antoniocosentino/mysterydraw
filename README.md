This is a small utility for creating small groups of people for the Styla Mystery Lunch.

The randomization is pretty simple, the idea is to avoid close repetitions as much as possible. The app is not saving any data, the list is created by the user and it's lost when the browser is closed / refreshed. For this reason it can be potentially used for any purpose.

To run locally:
- clone this repo
- `npm i`
- `npm start`
